PeopleContactsProject Android App Version 1.0 
By Kevin Lam

Source code available at https://github.com/anazei/PersonsContactsProject.git

Instructions:

- To create a record
You must type in a first and last name into both text fields to create a person record. 

The first and last name is not case sensitive and all names will be automatically converted into lowercase to keep each record non-case sensitive and unique. 

- To create additional records
To create a new record, clear either the first and/or last name text field and the button will display “add” again indicating that you are able to add a new person record.

- To access existing records
If you try to change the current record's first and last name to a matching person record that already exists, the display will just switch over to that existing profile and display its associated notes automatically.

- To update an existing record
After you have created a first and last name record, the “add” button will display “update” and you may update the name by simply changing either text field and pressing the update button. You can also update other existing records by accessing them first.

- To add notes to associate it to a record
Type in any notes to associate the note to the person record. If there are no notes, the text “no notes” will be displayed instead.

- To delete notes and person records
Hahaha, you can't! For some reason, there was no project requirement to delete any records so all person records are permanent... at least until you clear the app's cache manually.

Exciting App Features:

- Rotate the screen to use the app in both landscape and portrait mode!

- If you leave the app, the app will remember your shared preferences and restore them upon return

- If you close the app, the app will store all your person records in a database and restore the state of the app upon restarting the app

- Bonus Feature: Chromecast streaming video functionality! My Android team lead asked me to add this bonus feature in to make the project more challenging for me. If you have a Chromecast device connected on your network, the Chromecast icon will appear in the ActionBar next to the “play video” button. Click on the Chromecast icon to select a Chromecast device to broadcast to. Then click on “play video” to start the video stream app. If no chromecast device is detected, the icon will not appear and clicking on “play video” will do nothing.
